# ‚úÖ Health Dashboard Project Progress

## ‚úÖ Project Setup & Environment Initialization
- [x] Create a new Git repository.
- [x] Initialize a Node.js project for backend development.
- [x] Create a new React project (using Vite) for the frontend.
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations for code quality.
- [x] Install testing frameworks:
  - [x] Jest for backend tests.
  - [x] React Testing Library for frontend tests.
- [x] Write basic "Hello World" tests for both backend and frontend to verify the testing setup.

## ‚úÖ Backend Foundation with Netlify Functions
- [x] Create the folder structure for Netlify Functions.
- [x] Implement a basic "hello world" API endpoint.
- [x] Set up a local development environment that can emulate Netlify Functions.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the "hello world" endpoint.
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and logging in the endpoint.

## ‚úÖ MongoDB Integration and Schema Definition
- [x] Set up a connection to MongoDB Atlas from the Netlify Functions backend.
- [ ] Create schemas/models (using native driver) for:
  - [ ] User Settings
  - [ ] Activity Logs
  - [ ] Raw API Responses
- [ ] Write unit tests to verify the database connection and validate schema constraints.
- [x] Implement error handling and logging for database operations.

## üîê Authentication Module with Google OAuth
- [ ] Develop a backend endpoint to initiate the Google OAuth flow.
- [ ] Create a callback endpoint to handle the OAuth response and securely exchange the authorization code for tokens.
- [ ] Integrate the authentication flow with user settings storage in MongoDB.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests to simulate the login process and verify token storage.
- [ ] Ensure security best practices (use HTTPS and store tokens securely).

## üîÑ Data Sync & External API Integration
- [ ] Replace Zwift API integration with **Rouvy API**.
- [ ] Create a backend endpoint (e.g., POST `/api/sync`) to trigger data synchronization.
- [ ] Implement logic to fetch incremental updates from:
  - [ ] Strava API
  - [ ] Rouvy API
  - [ ] Samsung Health API
- [ ] Integrate caching mechanisms in MongoDB to avoid redundant API calls.
- [ ] Implement error handling with retry mechanism.
- [ ] Write tests to ensure incremental updates and caching work correctly.

## üß± Frontend Dashboard Setup
- [x] Wire up an initial API call to the backend `/api/hello` endpoint to test connectivity.
- [ ] Build a React dashboard layout with hybrid navigation.
- [ ] Implement a theme toggle.
- [ ] Create basic UI components and placeholders for data widgets.
- [ ] Write component tests for rendering.

## üìä Data Visualization & Filtering
- [ ] Integrate a charting library (Chart.js or Recharts).
- [ ] Develop line/bar chart components with mock data.
- [ ] Ensure charts are responsive.
- [ ] Implement UI controls for filtering (date, type, keyword).
- [ ] Develop backend aggregation functions.
- [ ] Write tests for rendering and filtering.

## üîî Notifications System
- [ ] Create backend endpoints to trigger notifications.
- [ ] Integrate email notifications via Resend.
- [ ] Develop in-app notification functionality.
- [ ] Connect notifications to user settings in MongoDB.
- [ ] Write tests for email + in-app alerts.

## üîÅ Integration & End-to-End Wiring
- [ ] Wire frontend components to backend endpoints.
- [ ] Ensure seamless flow for auth, sync, dashboard, notifications.
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests (Playwright).
- [ ] Validate error handling and logging.
- [ ] Remove unused code/components.

## üöÄ Performance, Security, and Final Testing
- [ ] Conduct API load testing.
- [ ] Perform security audits.
- [ ] Run integration tests for reliability.
- [ ] Document final configuration for Netlify + MongoDB.

## üìù Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Create developer documentation.
- [ ] Prepare for final code review.
- [ ] Deploy on Netlify with MongoDB Atlas.
- [ ] Verify production readiness.
