# Health Dashboard Project To-Do Checklist

This checklist outlines all the tasks required to build the Health Dashboard project, from initial setup to final integration and testing. Use this as a guide to ensure nothing is missed.

---

## Project Setup & Environment Initialization
- [ ] Create a new Git repository.
- [ ] Initialize a Node.js project for backend development.
- [ ] Create a new React project (using Create React App, Vite, or Next.js) for the frontend.
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations for code quality.
- [ ] Install testing frameworks:
  - [ ] Jest for backend tests.
  - [ ] React Testing Library for frontend tests.
- [ ] Write basic "Hello World" tests for both backend and frontend to verify the testing setup.

---

## Backend Foundation with Netlify Functions
- [ ] Create the folder structure for Netlify Functions.
- [ ] Implement a basic "hello world" API endpoint (e.g., GET `/api/hello`) that returns a simple JSON message.
- [ ] Set up a local development environment that can emulate Netlify Functions.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the "hello world" endpoint.
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and logging in the endpoint.

---

## MongoDB Integration and Schema Definition
- [ ] Set up a connection to MongoDB Atlas from the Netlify Functions backend.
- [ ] Create schemas/models (using Mongoose or native driver) for:
  - [ ] User Settings (unit preferences, theme selection, notification preferences)
  - [ ] Activity Logs (tracking steps, heart rate, distance, duration, cadence, calories burned)
  - [ ] Raw API Responses (to store original API data for debugging)
- [ ] Write unit tests to verify the database connection and validate schema constraints.
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging for database operations.

---

## Authentication Module with Google OAuth
- [ ] Develop a backend endpoint to initiate the Google OAuth flow.
- [ ] Create a callback endpoint to handle the OAuth response and securely exchange the authorization code for tokens.
- [ ] Integrate the authentication flow with user settings storage in MongoDB.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests to simulate the login process and verify token storage.
- [ ] Ensure security best practices (use HTTPS and store tokens securely).

---

## Data Sync & External API Integration
- [ ] Create a backend endpoint (e.g., POST `/api/sync`) to trigger data synchronization.
- [ ] Implement logic to fetch incremental updates from:
  - [ ] Strava API
  - [ ] Zwift API
  - [ ] Samsung Health API
- [ ] Integrate caching mechanisms in MongoDB to avoid redundant API calls.
- [ ] Implement error handling with a retry mechanism (exponential backoff) for failed API requests.
- [ ] Write tests to ensure:
  - [ ] Only new data is fetched (incremental updates).
  - [ ] Caching works correctly.
  - [ ] Errors are handled gracefully and fall back to cached data.

---

## Frontend Dashboard Setup
- [ ] Build a React dashboard layout with hybrid navigation (sidebar + top navigation).
- [ ] Implement a theme toggle (light/dark mode) that persists user preferences.
- [ ] Create basic UI components and placeholders for data widgets.
- [ ] Wire up an initial API call to the backend `/api/hello` endpoint to test connectivity.
- [ ] Write component tests using React Testing Library to ensure proper rendering.

---

## Data Visualization & Filtering
- [ ] Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) into the React project.
- [ ] Develop line chart components for displaying activity trends.
- [ ] Develop bar chart components for displaying activity trends.
- [ ] Populate charts with mock data initially.
- [ ] Ensure charts are responsive and update based on incoming data.
- [ ] Implement UI controls for filtering activity data by:
  - [ ] Date range
  - [ ] Activity type (cycling, running, etc.)
  - [ ] Keyword search
- [ ] Develop backend aggregation functions for:
  - [ ] Weekly/monthly totals (distance, calories burned)
  - [ ] Average pace and speed calculations
- [ ] Write tests for both chart rendering and filtering functionality.

---

## Notifications System
- [ ] Create backend endpoints using Netlify Functions to trigger notifications.
- [ ] Integrate email notifications via Resend for:
  - [ ] New personal bests
  - [ ] Daily/weekly activity summaries
  - [ ] Sync issues or API errors
- [ ] Develop in-app notification functionality for immediate feedback.
- [ ] Connect notification endpoints with user settings stored in MongoDB.
- [ ] Write tests to simulate notification triggers and verify processing for both email and in-app alerts.

---

## Integration & End-to-End Wiring
- [ ] Wire frontend components to the backend endpoints.
- [ ] Ensure a seamless flow:
  - [ ] User authentication
  - [ ] Data synchronization
  - [ ] Dashboard display
  - [ ] Notification delivery
- [ ] Develop end-to-end tests (using Playwright) to simulate complete user flows:
  - [ ] User logs in
  - [ ] Dashboard loads with cached data
  - [ ] User triggers "Sync Now"
  - [ ] Data updates and notifications are sent
- [ ] Validate error handling, caching, and logging across modules.
- [ ] Remove any orphaned components or unused code.

---

## Performance, Security, and Final Testing
- [ ] Conduct API load testing to ensure the backend handles multiple concurrent sync requests.
- [ ] Perform security audits:
  - [ ] Validate that API tokens are securely stored (using environment variables).
  - [ ] Test for vulnerabilities in authentication and data handling.
- [ ] Run comprehensive integration tests to confirm overall system reliability.
- [ ] Document final configuration and deployment steps for:
  - [ ] Netlify hosting
  - [ ] MongoDB Atlas connection

---

## Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Create detailed documentation for:
  - [ ] Project setup and configuration
  - [ ] Code structure and architectural decisions
  - [ ] Usage instructions for the dashboard
  - [ ] Deployment procedures
- [ ] Prepare final code review and cleanup.
- [ ] Deploy the application on Netlify and ensure MongoDB Atlas is correctly connected.
- [ ] Verify that the deployed application functions as expected in production.
